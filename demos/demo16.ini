; You can also try:
; strategy = fast  
; to try to converge as fast as possible

; strategy = safe
; to converge more slowly but with less

; Minimization algorithm
algorithm = migrad
;you can also try:
; strategy = simplex   
; To use the simplex algorithm instead of 
; mingrad.  This is usually worse but can
; occasionaly help for problems with
; extremely badly behaved derivatives of 
; the likelihood

; strategy = fallback
; To try mingrad but fall back to simplex
; if it fails.
