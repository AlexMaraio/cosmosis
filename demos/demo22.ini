nsample_dimension=20

; Save the output 100 at a time.  If we didn't set this it would use 20 as
; this is the nsample_dimension unless we ran multi-processor, in which
; case it would use 4*the MPI job size
nstep = 100

; File to save intermediate results.  ****  Does not work.  ****

; This sampler will refuse to run if the total number of sample points
; (the nsample_dimension multiplied by the number of variables in the
; 'values' file) is very large.  To force the issue and ignore the
; warning, set this value to true.
