; The Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background.
; Takes cosmological parameters as inputs
; Calculates matter power spectra and CMB power spectra as outputs.

[kirk]
; Donnacha Kirk's number density code.
; Takes a series of number density parameters as input.
; Calculates n(z) in bins as output.
; Assumes bin sizes chosen to have equal galaxy numbers in each.
