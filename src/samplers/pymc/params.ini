; This section of the ini file describes what program modules are run, where
; they can be found, and what likelihoods should be extracted at the end of the
; pipeline.  A single module does one part of the physical calculation, like
; generating the a power spectrum or computing a likelihood from some data.
;
; This set up of the pipeline just calculates CMB spectra and runs them through
; the WMAP-7 likelihood code, and so gives CMB-only constraints.

; These sections describe what the different named modules are and where to find them.
; You can have modules here that are not actually used, so you can switch between them just by changing the modules
; option at the top, rather than re-writing the whole file.

; TODO:
; The most important thing for the to-do list for these modules is to let them
; take arbitrary named parameters for a setup function, so that, for example,
; you could select which data-set to use for a given run.
