explanation: >
    pocoMC relies on the Preconditioned Monte Carlo algorithm which utilises a Normalising Flow 
    in order to decorrelate the parameters of the posterior, and facilitates efficient sampling 
    of probability distributions with non-trivial geometries.

    It generates both posterior samples and Bayesian evidences.

    PocoMC does not currently support checkpointing (all the output appears at the end of the run)
    or derived parameters.
    

installation: >
    if using conda, do this first to ensure consistent dependencies:
        conda install -c conda-forge corner pytorch tqdm
    pip install pocomc


# List of configuration options for this sampler
params:
    n_particles: (integer) Number of particles/walkers
    nsample_add: (integer; default=0) Number of extra posterior samples to draw at the end 
    threshold: (float; default=1.0) The threshold value for the (normalised) proposal scale parameter below which normalising flow preconditioning (NFP) is enabled. Default is to always enable.
    scale: (bool; default=N) Whether to scale the distribution of particles to have zero mean and unit variance
    rescale: (bool; default=N) Whether to rescale the distribution of particles to have zero mean and unit variance in every iteration
    diagonal: (bool; default=T) Use a diagonal covariance matrix when rescaling instead of a full covariance
    ess: (float; default=0.95) The effective sample size maintained during the run
    gamma: (float; default=0.75) Threshold for the correlation coefficient that is used to adaptively determine the number of MCMC steps
    n_min: (int; default=ndim/2) Minimum number of MCMC steps per iteration
    n_max: (int; default=ndim*10) Maximum number of MCMC steps per iteration
    seed: (int; default=0) A random seed for reproducibility. Default is to generate automatically.
