explanation: >
    "kombine is an ensemble sampler that uses a clustered kernel-density-estimate proposal density, which allows it to efficiently sample multimodal or non-gaussian posteriors. In between updates to the proposal density estimate, each member of the ensemble is sampled independently, allowing for massive parallelization."

installation: >
    "kombine can be installed from github using pip: pip install --user git+git://github.com/bfarr/kombine"

params:
    walkers: number of independent walkers in the ensemble
    samples: total sample steps taken 
    nsteps: number of sample steps taken in between 
    update_interval: number of steps taken in between updating the posterior 
    start_file: (optional) a file containing starting points for the walkers. If not specified walkers are initialized randomly from the prior distribution.
