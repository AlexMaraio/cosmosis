Welcome to CosmoSIS
===================

CosmoSIS is a **cosmological parameter estimation code**.  It is now at **version 1.4**

It is a framework for structuring cosmological parameter estimation in a way that eases re-usability, debugging, verifiability, and code sharing in the form of calculation [modules](modules).

It consolidates and connects together existing code for predicting cosmic observables, and makes mapping out experimental likelihoods with a range of different techniques much more accessible

CosmoSIS is described in Zuntz et al: http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3409 - if you make use of it in your research, please cite that paper and include the URL of this repository in your acknowledgments. Thanks!
